	<div class="item">
	  <p>MaRCo aims to produce a visual environment for specifying
	    norms and business processes with an underlying formal
	    model, and for checking regulatory compliance of business
	    processes. MaRCo plans to achieve the following objectives
	    in order to attain this goal:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Development of textual norm representation languages.
	      This aims at representing and reasoning about
	      regulations concerned with business processes. In
	      particular, we are interested in three challenges in
	      norm compliance. First, business processes incorporate
	      complex temporal constraints and reasoning, concerned
	      also with the dynamics of norms. Second, we want to be
	      able to represent and reason about norms that regulate
	      what should be known in an organization, such as
	      awareness of exceptional circumstances in risk
	      management, and what should not be known in an
	      organization, such as privacy regulations. Third,
	      business regulations not only prescribe which kind of
	      states are permitted or forbidden, but they also
	      regulate the documentation and explanation in business
	      processes.
	    </li>
	    <li>Development of visual language for the representation
	      of business regulations. This language should enable the
	      visual expression of regulations in terms of deontic
	      concepts, such as permissions, prohibitions and
	      obligations. The aim is to produce a language that is
	      usable by business domain experts. The semantics of the
	      visual language is to be expressed in the norm
	      representation language.
	    </li>
	    <li>Development of a tool for modeling norms, business
	      processes and checking compliance. The tool has to
	      support an environment for business process and norm
	      modeling based on the visual language for representing
	      norms, an existing business process modeling language
	      and the norm representation languages. The tool should
	      interface with an existing compliance checking
	      tool. This implies the need for mapping our visual
	      notation of processes and rules to the input language of
	      the verification tool, and mapping the results of the
	      verification tool back to a visual representation in our
	      environment.
	    </li>
	    <li>Study the complexity of the compliance problem. The
	      aim is to study the compliance problem ay an abstract
	      theoretical level. This is known to be a problem of
	      substantial complexity; the aim is to understand it and
	      suggest possible ways to improve the efficiency of
	      compliance checking algorithms.
	    </li>
	    <li>Validation of tool, and developed languages using a
	      case study. This aims at applying the tool to a case
	      study, which involves selecting a case study either from
	      the literature or from industry. The case study is
	      important in validating and refining our tool and
	      languages.
