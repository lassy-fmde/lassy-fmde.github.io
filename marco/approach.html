	  <h2>A visual environment for modeling and checking BP
	  compliance</h2>
	  <p>MaRCo aims to provide an integrated visual environment
	  for business process compliance modelling and checking. This
	  environment should enable specification of business norms,
	  business processes and for checking compliance of business
	  processes against the norms that govern them. Norm and
	  business process visual specification involves three
	  components (see Figure below): the data model, the
	  specification of norms, and the business processes.
	  </p>
	  <p style="text-align: center">

	  </p>
	  <p>The data model defines a common vocabulary shared by both
	  norms and business processes. Norm specification and
	  constraints of business processes are described in terms of
	  the things introduced in the data model. To specify data
	  models and norms we propose
	  the <a href="http://vcl.gforge.uni.lu/">Visual Contract
	  Language (VCL)</a>, our visual language under
	  development. VCL should, however, be extended to enable
	  specification of norms in terms of deontic concepts such as
	  permissions, prohibitions, and obligations. For business
	  process specification, we plan to use an existing visual
	  language. From the visual representations created by the
	  user, the relevant definitions are extracted for the purpose
	  of compliance checking by mapping them into a formal textual
	  language that enables representation of norms and compliance
	  checking.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="item">
	  <h2>Representation of norms</h2> 
	  <p>We extend existing theories of norms in three
	  directions.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Complex temporal constraints and reasoning, concerned
	      also with the dynamics of norms.  One example of a
	      representation problem presently discussed in the
	      normative systems community and relevant for the norm
	      compliance problem is the issue of norm change. Formal
	      models of norm change have been drawing attention since
	      the seminal works of Alchourrón and Bulygin on normative
	      systems, and that of Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and
	      Makinson on the logic of theory change. In order to
	      represent the dynamics of obligations and permissions,
	      several deontic logics have been proposed. However,
	      these systems did not explicitly refer to possible
	      changes in the underlying norms - if norms were
	      mentioned, they were assumed to be invariable. For the
	      latest developments in areas such as the study of
	      virtual organizations and communities, distributed
	      environments like electronic institutions, multiagent
	      systems, and p2p networks, the static view of norms no
	      longer suffices. The relevance of norm dynamic to the
	      issue of ensuring the compliance of buinsses processes
	      is that after changes in a normative system there are no
	      guarantees that a previously compliant process is still
	      compliant with the new norms. In addition there are some
	      gray cases: long lasting processes whose execution span
	      over some changes in the norms. While some simple cases
	      of norm dynamic can be handled by the approach by
	      Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson, it does not handle
	      time (in particular retroactive norm
	      modifications). Research and practice in the legal field
	      have identified a rich ontology of norm changes. To
	      apply this knowledge to compliance we have to
	      investigate formal models able to capture a large and
	      significant corpus of norm changes, to understand the
	      mechanisms governing these changes, and then to
	      investigate the effects of norm changes to business
	      processes and to develop techniques to propagate the
	      changes from the formal model to represent compliance
	      requirements to business processes in order to maintain
	      their compliance. Our starting point for this would be
	      the model of Governatori-Rotolo to represent
	      the use of time in defeasible logic to model some types
	      of norm dynamics, and to relate it to formal compliance
	      checking models.
	    </li>
	    <li>Norms regulating what should or should not be known in
	      an organization. Though deontic logic (the logic of
	      norms and obligations) and epistemic logic (the logic of
	      knowledge and beliefs) have both been developed as
	      branches of modal logic, only recently they have been
	      combined to express what should be known, and what is
	      known about the obligations. We expect that these
	      combined logics will prove useful to represent
	      regulatory norms about business processes. For example,
	      in risk management it is often important that the
	      organization is aware of exceptional circumstances, such
	      as norm violations, and thus there are norms about
	      monitoring of processes. The challenge here is that not
	      everything may be known, not only due to physical
	      constraints, but in particular due to privacy
	      concerns. Norms that forbid certain derivations about
	      the state of individuals in an organization tend to give
	      rise to challenging problems. The dynamic theory of
	      normative systems will be extended with theory of
	      dynamic epistemic logic to describe the dynamic of
	      knowledge in organizations. There are several
	      researchers in the ICR group (led by Prof. van der
	      Torre) working on dynamic epistemic logic (Emil Weydert,
	      Guilaume Aucher, Mathijs de Boer), and there is a course
	      on dynamic epistemic logic in the academic master in
	      computer science, such that needed expertise is locally
	      available.
	    </li>
	    <li>Regulation of the documentation and explanation in
	      business processes. Besides the theory of normative
	      systems, another important theory in the field of
	      artificial intelligence and law is argumentation and
	      dialogue. This theory explains how (legal and other)
	      arguments can be constructed, and which arguments are
	      acceptable in a dialogue. The theory also provides an
	      explanation why arguments are acceptable or not. In
	      legal theory this is used to represent and reason about
	      legal cases in a court, but we expect that it can also
	      be used to reason about explanation in norm compliance
	      when the theory is incorporated in the theory of
	      normative systems. For example, for risk management
	      exceptional circumstances must be explained by
	      arguments, and documented. Starting point is the
	      abstract argumentation theory of Dung, which is further
	      developed in the ICR group by Dov Gabbay, Martin
	      Caminada, Yining Wu, and others.

	  <h2>Complexity reduction</h2>
	  <p>One of the challenges in checking the compliance of
	    business processes is due to the large number of execution
	    traces that may exist for the business process. In the
	    worst-case this number will be at least exponential in the
	    size of the business process. We propose four approaches
	    for handling the complexity of compliance checking: -
	    Impose design restrictions on the business processes: if
	    we can identify those features in business process that
	    lead to high complexity, we can restrict the design of the
	    business processes in such a way that these features
	    cannot occur. In order to do this we have to study what
	    are the causes for the complexity (interaction between
	    compliance requirements and the structure of a business
	    process). We intend to study techniques to restructure the
	    original process (or part of it) into an equivalent
	    process (sub-process) satisfying the compliance
	    requirements. This approach is only feasible when
	    designing business processes from scratch since existing
	    business process may well violate these
	    requirements. Furthermore we need to investigate if these
	    design restrictions give the business analyst enough
	    flexibility to express the business requirements. If this
	    is not the case, one of the next three approaches could be
	    used.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Give upper bounds on the time needed for checking
	      compliance: for this we will need to perform a thorough
	      analysis of how the structure of the business process
	      influences the time complexity of compliance
	      checking. An upper bound estimation must give the
	      business analyst enough information to decide whether
	      the business process needs redesigning or whether the
	      expected time is acceptable within the current context.
	    </li>
	    <li>Use a tool for finding counterexamples over small
	      search spaces: we can view the problem of compliance
	      checking as a problem of finding a counterexample to the
	      claim that the business process does satisfy a set of
	      rules. This opens up the possibility of using a tool
	      that performs checking on bounded spaces to find such a
	      counterexample. In this context we will investigate the
	      use of the Alloy Analyzer for expressing and
	      checking compliance. The Alloy analyzer is a tool that
	      checks for the existence of counterexamples by exploring
	      a finite set of possible configurations (whose size can
	      be influenced by the user). The alloy analyzer will find
	      a counterexample provided that the "small scope
	      hypothesis" holds: this hypothesis essentially states
	      that if there is a counterexample then there is one of
	      small size. We will investigate the set of compliance
	      checking problems for which the small scope hypothesis
	      can be proven: for these cases the Alloy analyzer could
	      be used to check compliance fairly quickly.</li>
	    <li>Another way to tackle complexity is the reuse of
	      existing compliance checking results. The compliance
	      checking results should be reused whenever possible. A
	      checking is only necessary w.r.t. the additional details
	      which have been inserted. Also, facing the problem of
	      changing norms (as described above), existing compliance
	      results should be reused instead of a complete re-check
	      for compliance. The approach is based on the idea of
	      optimization by reuse, of result propagation and
	      compositional approaches.
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Tool implementation</h2> 
	  <p>MaRCo proposes to build a tool to support the integrated
	    environment for modelling and checking compliance. The
	    following figure sketches the main graphical user interface
	    (GUI) that we expect from this tool. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p style="text-align: center">
	    <a href="img/MaRCoToolInterface.png" target="_blank">
	      <img src="img/MaRCoToolInterface.png" alt="MaRCo Tool Interface" title="MaRCo Tool Interface" hspace="6" border="0" width="500">
	    </a>
	  </p>
	  <p>(Click on image to enlarge)</p>
	  
	  <p>The panel to the left labelled "Rules" lists norms. Each
	    norm has a name; by clicking one of the listed norms, the
	    user is allowed to view and edit the norm visually or
	    textually (if visual specification is not possible or
	    practical). New rules can be added and existing rules can
	    be deleted. The panel in the middle labelled "Business
	    Process" shows business process models. It is specified in
	    one of the existing visual notations such as BPMN or EPC,
	    by dragging and placing the icons from the toolbar located
	    on top of the panel. The panel to the right labelled "Data
	    Dictionary" lists all the relevant concepts extracted from
	    the business norms and the business process. They can be
	    dragged and placed in the notes attached to the tasks in
	    the business process in order to specify predicates that
	    hold on them. Finally, the panel at the bottom displays
	    the output. Editing the rules or/and the business process
	    involves the execution of the compliance checking on the
	    back stage.</p>

	  <p>Depending on the result, three types of outputs are
	    considered:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Compliance is displayed in green.</li>
	    <li>An alert in red is issued when the editing introduces
	      non-compliance. In this case, the relevant parts in both
	      the business process and the rule list are highlighted
	      accordingly.</li>
	    <li>A warning in red is issued when the editing causes a
	      potential computational complexity in compliance
	      checking. This situation will be reported to the
	      designer for his/her awareness. The designer can either
	      accept the complexity and be prepared for the long
	      duration of the compliance checking, or decide to do
	      something to avoid the complexity. In most cases, such
	      complexity can be avoided by simply re-writing the rules
	      or the process business.</li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>The proposed tool interface is a first alternative how an
	    integrated compliance environment might look like. Further
	    investigation is necessary to express the different kinds
	    of norms, regulations and also to conveniently represent
	    the compliance checking results. The user should be
	    further supported in correcting the model or maybe even
	    the norms to achieve the norms. The change of norms
	    mentioned above has to be taken into consideration.
	    Besides the graphical representation of business
	    processes, norms and rules and their compliance there has
	    to be a connection to the compliance technology in the
	    background. The red alert message needs some sophisticated
	    processing which is not directly visible in the
	    interface. It is necessary to map the model and the
	    regulations designed on the tool interface to a low-level
	    compliance model. To perform compliance checking there are
	    two ways in principal:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>a new and very specialized compliance technology is
	      developed;</li>
	    <li>existing formal technology is
	      employed.</li> 
	  </ol>
	  <p>Instead of a re-development the application of existing
	    and thus matured technology is preferred. To achieve this,
	    different mappings from the high-level interface models to
	    such existing low-level checking input has to be
	    investigated. Different checking technology has to be
	    considered (e.g. Alloy, model checking, constraint
	    systems). Bridging this gap between business process level
	    and lower checking level it has to be taken care that the
	    semantic loss is controlled. Moreover, the checking
	    results have to be mapped back to the high-level graphical
	    representation.
