          <h1 id="anouncement">Announcement of Experiment VCL vs UML+OCL</h1>
          <p>
          The researcher and former York student Nuno Amálio (nuno.amalio@uni.lu) is organising a 
          controlled experiment to evaluate a software design modelling language that is currently being developed at the University of 
          Luxembourg: the Visual Contract Language (VCL, http://vcl.gforge.uni.lu).
          </p>
          <p>
		  Nuno invites University of York students to participate in this experiment that will compare 
		  VCL against UML and OCL, the software industry standards. 

Participation is voluntary, but rewarded with a £42 amazon.co.uk voucher. All taught and research students are invited to participate. All that is required is that you have completed a course on object-oriented design using UML or other similar notation.

The experiment will run on the week between the 24th and the 28th of June. It requires 12 hours of your time to be split between training (UML, OCL and VCL) and execution of the experiment's tasks.

This is also a good opportunity to improve your software design modelling skills, which are increasingly important in the software industry.

Nuno welcomes your participation. Please contact him at nuno.amalio@uni.lu if you interested in participating.

		  <li>Type "Papyrus" into the "Find" box.
		  </li>
		  <li>Check the checkbox next to the "Papyrus (Incubation)" entry, then click the "Finish" button.
		  </li>
		  <li>Confirm the "Install" wizard that pops up by clicking "Next", then "Next" again, then accept the license agreement and click "Finish".</li>
		  <li>Choose "Yes" when asked whether to restart Eclipse.</li>
		  <li>Open the Papyrus perspective by choosing "Window&rarr;Open Perspective&rarr;Other..." from the menu, and then selecting the "Papyrus"
		  perspective and confirming by clicking "Ok".</li>
