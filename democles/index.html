		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>A goal of model-driven development is the generation of the
		full implementation of a system based on a precise description of
		a platform-independent model. Such a description
		must accurately specify the static structure as well as the
		dynamic behavior of the system. EP is a modeling language that supports this approach to software development.</p>
		<p>The DEMOCLES tool offers a
		declarative approach to specifying an executable
		platform-independent model (based on the EP-language). It improves on traditional approaches
		that are imperative in nature (e.g., action languages) or that are only
		applicable in particular cases (e.g., state charts).

		<h2>20-Sep-2011: Generation of code for Android and iPhone and The Mobile Library Experiment</h2>
		<p> We provide an experiment illustrating our approach to code generation based on templates. 	
		You can run the experiment, which takes a sample EP model and generates both Android and iPhone applications from it, from here: 
        <br><br>

		<h2>18-Jan-2011: Model Decomposition plugin available</h2>
		<p>Democles introduces a new feature for decomposing EP models.
		The basic idea is to subdivide EP models into smaller sub-models with the property that
		these sub-models are valid EP models, too.  Compared to the original EP model, the
		sub-models are smaller and less complex. They can be viewed within Democles and be
		understood following the EP semantics. 
		</p>
		
		<p>This new feature is provided by an independent plugin that implements a generic
		model decomposition technique. Democles is configured so that
		the model decomposition plugin is automatically included.
		You can also install the model decomposition plugin on its own, and use it to
		decompose models of any Ecore metamodels.
		</p>
		
		<p>A paper reporting the theory of the generic model decomposition technique and
		its application in model comprehension is accepted for publication in the
		proceedings of <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~orejas/FASE.html">FASE'11</a>. The companion
		technical report gives more details: <a href="documentation/TR_LASSY_10_06.pdf">

        <h2>26-November-2010: New release of Democles available.</h2>
        <p>This new version of Democles introduces a mechanism for generating
        runnable applications on both Android and iPhone platforms by instantiating templates. The templates are described using the 
        Formal Template language (FTL).<br><br>
        
        You can try the sample EP model and generate both Android and iPhone applications from it:

        <h2>16-June-2009: New release of Democles available.</h2>
        <p>This new version of Democles introduces support for <b>Platform Bindings</b>. It requires
        Eclipse 3.4.<br>
        <br>
        Other changes are:
        <ul>
        <li>Updated Documentation.</li>
        <li>Better handling of the workspace with regards to the refreshing of resources.</li>
        <li>Added rename refactoring for domains and bridges.</li>
        <li>Added wizard for exporting a Democles system as a runnable JAR file.</li>
        <li>Added wizards to create, import and export platform bindings as well as a GUI allowing to choose which binding should be active.</li>
        <li>Many other improvements and bug fixes.</li>
        </ul>
        We also provide <a href="documentation/browserexample.html">an example project including platform bindings</a>.

        <h2>10-October-2008: New release of Democles available.</h2>        
        <p>This new version of Democles introduces support for <b>Domain Hierarchies</b>.<br>
        <br>
		The basic notion is that of a domain: a self-contained subject matter. In Democles
		all domains are expressed using a common meta-language called EP.
		Domains are not sufficient to express a working system since the domains
		have to interact to realize a software system.<br>
        <br>		
		Bridges constitute the main mechanism for effecting this interaction. A
		bridge is defined over a number of domains. In contrast to domains bridges
		have external links into the domains over which they are defined. Through these
		external links events can be propagated from one domain to another domain.
		Bridges are also responsible for converting data types from one domain to
		another domain.<br>
        <br>		
		We can view the bridge and the underlying domains as a new domain since the
		union of these structures does not have external links. We can thus view a system
		model as a hierarchy of domains, with a single top-level domain representing the
		application. The main purpose of the Democles tool is to provide facilities to
		model software applications as a domain hierarchy.

        <h2>19-August-2008: New Democles release available</h2>        
        <p>A new version of Democles has been released. Additionally to being compatible
        with Eclipse 3.3, Democles can now also be used with Eclipse 3.4.
        </p>
        
        <h2>29-May-2008: Democles Website made available</h2>        
        <p>An early version of the Democles Website is now accessible at
        <a href="https://lassy-fmde.github.io/democles/">http://democles.lassy.uni.lu/</a>.
